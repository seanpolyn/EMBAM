# EMBAM
Episodic Memory Behavioral Analysis in MATLAB (EMBAM)

This is a MATLAB-based toolbox that is designed to support analysis of behavioral psychology experiments.  It currently has a heavy focus on analysis of data from free-recall experiments, with a particular emphasis on organizational analysis examining the order of responses.

The code in the EMBAM toolbox was developed by researchers in the Computational Memory Lab at U. Penn. (PI: Michael Kahana) and the Vanderbilt Computational Memory Lab (PI: Sean Polyn).  For a hopefully up-to-date list of contributors, see the AUTHORS file.
